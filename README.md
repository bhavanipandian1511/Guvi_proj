This project is just a UI design for a Hackathon which is conducted in GUVI. The website holds the healthy and organic products which are sold <br>
I have took the UI from my friend's figma design and used my one creativity for styling <br>

I also hosted the webpage in vercel with both mobile and pc version supported <br>

If need any changes need free feel to fork. <br>
