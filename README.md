*This project is just a UI design for a Hackathon which is conducted in GUVI. The website holds the healthy and organic products which are sold.<br>
*I have took the UI from my friend's figma design and used my one creativity for styling.<br>
*This link re-directs to the figma design page.<br>
*This project is successfully done by bhavanipandian1511 and saibabu10.
